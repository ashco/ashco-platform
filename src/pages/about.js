          Hi, I’m Ashton. I'm a lifelong learner and love the challenges of
          coding. I've been interested in tech since I was young and have grown
          familiar with many aspects of the industry. I’ve worked in the clouds,
          solved problems way past my bedtime, and even built a mining rig (or
          three). I'm excited to apply these skills to whatever I do going
          forward and am happy to talk about my experiences so far. Hit me up!
